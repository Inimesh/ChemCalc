# Chemcalc

DISCLAIMER:
This was my first ever software project so the code is not clean, has no automated testing and does not adhere to OOP best practices.

---
This is a GUI tool for synthetic chemists to avoid tedious calculations and scale
reactant quantities from experimental sections of academic papers to suit their needs!

It was built using Python.
Tkinter is used to build the interface.
Pandas and numpy libraries are used in the logic modules.

I have future plans to connect it to an API to have autocomplete features when
entering innate chemical properties (e.g. molecular mass, density etc.).

## Dependencies

- Python3

 Modules: 
- tkinter
- numpy
- pandas

## To Run

```
python3 cc_UI.py 
```
