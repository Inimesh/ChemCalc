# ChemCalc

DISCLAIMER:
This was my first ever software project so the code is not clean, has no automated testing and does not adhere to OOP best practices.

## Description

This is a GUI tool for synthetic chemists to avoid tedious calculations. The user can enter reactant quantities and yields from literature experimentals, and then enter the desired amount of the product. ChemCalc calculates the exact amounts (quoting the number of mols and mass/volume as appropriate) needed to repeat the experiment in order to acheive the target amount of product applying the quoted literature yield.

This project started out as an excel spreadsheet (using nested IF statements) that I made to help ease a tedious task that I found myself doing a lot as part of my final research project while at university. I hope that someone else will find this as useful as I did.
