This is a tool for synthetic chemists to avoid tedious calculations and scale
reactant quantities from experimental sections of academic papers to suit their needs!

It was built using Python.
Tkinter is used to build the interface.
Pandas and numpy libraries are used in the logic modules.

I have future plans to connect it to an API to have autocomplete features when
entering innate chemical properties (e.g. molecular mass, density etc.).
